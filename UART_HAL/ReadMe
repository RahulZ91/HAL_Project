What was done:

1. Created the project template using the CubeMX 
2. Set the UART2 peripheral to asynchronous
3. Removed the contents of the main.c,it.c,msp.c, main.h and it.h
4. Added the HAL_Init() and SystemClockConfig() to the main.c
5. Implemented the weak function HAL_MspInit in stm32f4xx_hal_msp.c
   5.1 Task 1: Setup the processor priority grouping- NVIC_PRIORITYGROUP_0 then no interrupts can be directly configured
	             HAL_NVIC_SetPriorityGrouping(NVIC_PRIORITYGROUP_4);

  5.2. Task 2 : Enable the required system exceptions of the ARM Cortex M4 system exceptions
	              // #include "stm32f4xx.h" includes the SCB definition - so make sure to include it
	              Task was carried out by accessing SCB->SHCSR and setting the bits 17,18 and 19

  5.3. Task 3 : Setup the priority for the system exceptions
                The function HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() was used

6. Low level initialisation
Note: GPIO peripheral does not have a handle structure
Updated the 
	6.1. Clock 
	6.2. GPIO clock and structure
	6.3. GPIO in alternate mode for USART TX AND RX
	6.4. Enabling the interrupt with the HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ

7. High level initialisation
	7.1 For the UART2 peripheral - create a handle type def for UART2
	7.2 Create a function for initialise the parameters
	7.3 Link the structure for the *initialisation - use the base address of the UART2 peripheral
	7.4 use the init to initialise the different parameters such as baudrate, mode etc
